Because I spent too much time redoing my gulp tasks, I make this to work 
with a unique configuration file written in YAML.

The project is inspired by [**Blendid** *(formerly known as Gulp Starter)*](https://github.com/vigetlabs/blendid).

## Quick start on a fresh project (empty directory)

Install **gulpfile.js**:
```bash
yarn init
yarn add gulpfile.js --dev
yarn run gulpfile
```

Create configuration files:
```bash
touch gulpconfig.yml
touch .eslintrc
```

Start **gulpfile.js**:
```bash
yarn run gulpfile
```

## Commands

All commands should be run through yarn run. If you haven't switched to [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)
yet, now's a great time!

```bash
yarn run gulpfile
```

This is where the magic happens. The perfect front-end workflow. This runs the
development task, which starts compiling, watching, and live updating all our 
files as we change them. Browsersync will start a server on port 3000, or do 
whatever you've configured it to do. You'll be able to see live changes in all
connected browsers.

```bash
yarn run gulpfile build
```

Compiles files to your destination directory.

It's a good idea to add aliases for these commands to your package.json scripts object.

package.json:
```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "start": "yarn run gulpfile",
    "build": "yarn run gulpfile build"
  }
}
```

Command line:
```bash
yarn start
yarn run build
```

## Configuring tasks

Except for browsersync, all section define a set of tasks build on the same
template. Each section define 2 entries:
- tasks: list of tasks
- settings: global override of task settings

For each tasks, you can override settings globally or for the task only. All
options is detailed below.

### Browsersync

Override default settings and watch files not watched by other tasks.

**Template:**
```yaml
browsersync:
  settings:
    server:
      baseDir: "build/"
  watch:
    - "**/*.html"
```

In this configuration, files in `build` directory will by served at 
http://localhost:3000 and all changes on HTML file will reload the browser. You
can proxy an existing website as written below:

```yaml
browsersync:
  settings:
    proxy: "http://website.dev"
```

### Pug

Build PUG files into HTML. In the template below, one task called `public` is 
defined and compile all PUG files in directory `assets/views` in HTML file 
stored in `build`. You can pass data to PUG with `data` settings.

**Template:**
```yaml
pug:
  tasks:
    public:
      src:
        - "assets/views/**/*.pug"
      dst: "build"
      settings:
        data: "pugdata-task.yml"
  settings:
    data: "pugdata.yml"
```

### SASS

Build SASS files into CSS. In the template below, one task called `public` is 
defined and compile all SASS files in directory `assets/sass` in HTML file 
stored in `build/css`. You can override settings of SASS and autoprefixer.

**Template:**
```yaml
sass:
  tasks:
    public:
      src:
        - "assets/sass/**/*.scss"
      dst: "build/css"
  settings:
    sass:
      errLogToConsole: true
    autoprefixer:
      browsers:
        - "> 1%"
        - "IE >= 9"
      cascade: false
```

- [Autoprefixer](https://github.com/postcss/autoprefixer#options)
      
### JavaScript

Build javascript files into two files: one with all scripts and the other 
minified. In the template below, one task called `public` is defined and 
compile all javascript files in directory `assets/js` in two files (app.js and
app.min.js) stored in `build/js`. You can override settings of browserify and
babel.

**Template:**
```yaml
javascript:
  tasks:
    public:
      src:
        - "assets/js/*.js"
      dst: "build/js"
      filename: "app.js"
```

- [Babel](https://babeljs.io/docs/core-packages/#options)

### Images

Minify images with [imagemin](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gulp-imagemin). In
the template below, one task called `public` is defined and optimize all images
in directory `assets/images` and store them in `build/images`. You can override 
settings of imagemin.

**Template:**
```yaml
images:
  tasks:
    public:
      src:
        - "assets/images/**/*.png"
        - "assets/images/**/*.jpg"
        - "assets/images/**/*.jpeg"
        - "assets/images/**/*.gif"
        - "assets/images/**/*.svg"
      dst: "build/images"
  settings:
    optimizationLevel: 4
```

### Sprites

Convert a set of images into a spritesheet and CSS variables. The two templates
below show the two way to define sprites: first one is normal method, the second
is for retina configuration. All images in `assets/sprites` will be converted in
a sprite stored in `build/images`. The name of the task define the name of the 
sprite file but you can add a prefix. SASS file is build in `assets/sass/sprites`.
You can override settings of imagemin.

**Template:**
```yaml
sprites:
  tasks:
    icon:
      src:
        - "assets/sprites/*.png"
        - "assets/sprites/*.jpg"
      dst: "build/images"
      settings:
        sass:
          dst: "assets/sass/sprites"
          rel: "../images"
        prefix: "icon"
  settings:
    imagemin:
      optimizationLevel: 4
```

```yaml
sprites:
  tasks:
    icon:
      src-1x:
        - "assets/sprites/*.png"
        - "assets/sprites/*.jpg"
      src-2x:
        - "assets/sprites/*@2x.png"
        - "assets/sprites/*@2x.jpg"
      dst: "build/images"
      settings:
        sass:
          dst: "assets/sass/sprites"
          rel: "../images"
        prefix: "icon"
  settings:
    imagemin:
      optimizationLevel: 4
```

### Fonts

Convert a set of SVG files in fonts files and a SASS file using 
[spritesmith](https://github.com/Ensighten/spritesmith). In the template below,
one task called `custom` is defined. It convert SVG files in directory 
`assets/svg` and store fonts files into `build/fonts`. You can override font 
name with 2 settings `prefix` and `name`.

**Template:**
```yaml
fonts:
  tasks:
    custom:
      src:
        - "assets/svg/*.svg"
      dst: "build/fonts"
      settings:
        sass:
          dst: "assets/sass/fonts"
          rel: "../fonts"
        prefix: "font"
        name: "icon"
  settings:
    template: "fontawesome"
```
